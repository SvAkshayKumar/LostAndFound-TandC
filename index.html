                            <li>Event organizers within the RV University community using the check-in feature are responsible for ensuring that any attendee data uploaded (e.g., via Excel sheets) has been collected in compliance with applicable data protection laws and University policies, including obtaining necessary consents.</li>
                            <li>RV University provides the platform for check-in but is not responsible for the accuracy of event data provided by organizers or for their data handling practices outside of the App's processing for the check-in function.</li>
                            <li>Attendees should direct queries about their data related to a specific event to the respective event organizer. Attendees can request App support for assistance in understanding how their data is processed by the App for check-in purposes.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Users will receive essential notifications related to their App activity (e.g., item matches, claim status updates, critical security alerts) by default through App notifications or registered email.</li>
                            <li>Users may have options to manage preferences for non-critical notifications (e.g., general App updates, reminders) in their account settings, where available.</li>
                            <li>RV University is not liable for missed notifications due to incorrect user settings, device issues, network failures, or email deliverability problems outside of its direct control. Users are responsible for ensuring their contact information is up-to-date.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The App's database and critical system data are backed up regularly (e.g., daily) to secure cloud storage or on-premise backup systems to prevent data loss in case of server failures or other disasters.</li>
                            <li>In the event of a data loss incident, RV University will make commercially reasonable efforts to restore data from the most recent available backup. However, complete recovery of all data up to the point of failure cannot be guaranteed.</li>
                            <li>Users are encouraged to keep their own records of important information submitted to the App (e.g., details of valuable lost items) as an additional precaution, where appropriate.</li>
